## What is OpenTelemetry?

Think of OpenTelemetry like a health monitor for your computer applications. Just like a fitness tracker monitors your steps, heart rate, and sleep, OpenTelemetry monitors what's happening inside your software.

															OR


Think of OpenTelemetry like the black box on an airplane. Just as a black box records flight data and cockpit conversations to help understand what happened during a flight, OpenTelemetry records metrics, logs, and traces from your applications to help developers understand how the software is performing and diagnose any issues.


## Why do we need it?


Imagine you have a restaurant. If a customer complains that their food took too long, you'd want to know:
* Did the kitchen get the order quickly?
* How long did cooking take?
* Was the waiter slow to deliver it?
Similarly, when your app is slow or breaks, OpenTelemetry helps you find out exactly where the problem is.



## What does OpenTelemetry collect?


It gathers three main types of information:

### 1. Traces - Like a delivery tracking system
* Shows the journey of a request through your app
* "Order received ‚Üí Kitchen started ‚Üí Food cooked ‚Üí Delivered"



### 2. Metrics - Like counting things
* How many users visited your app?
* How fast is your app responding?
* How much memory is being used?


### 3. Logs - Like a diary
* Records what happened and when
* "User logged in at 2:30 PM"
* "Error occurred in payment system"

											OR


Think of running a movie theater:

### 1. Traces ‚Äì Like following a moviegoer's experience 
You can see the full path: "Ticket purchased ‚Üí Entered theater ‚Üí Watched movie ‚Üí Left the building" Just like tracing a user's request through your app.





### 2. Metrics ‚Äì Like theater stats 	
You track numbers: 	
* How many people watched each movie? 	
* How long was the average wait time in line? 	
* How many snacks were sold? 	
Just like tracking usage, speed, and resource consumption in your app.


### 3. Logs ‚Äì Like a theater logbook 
You keep a written record: 
* "Projector started at 6:00 PM" 
* "Issue with sound in Hall 2" 
Just like your app records important events and errors.





## How does integration work?

Integration is like setting up security cameras in a store:
* Install the cameras ‚Äì Like adding OpenTelemetry to your code
* Choose what to watch ‚Äì Like configuring which parts of your app to monitor (e.g., checkout, search)
* Send footage to a monitor room ‚Äì Like sending data to a backend (e.g., Prometheus, Jaeger, or Grafana)
* Watch the recordings ‚Äì Like reviewing logs, metrics, and traces to see what's happening


## Real example:


If your website has a "login" button, OpenTelemetry can tell you:
* How many people clicked it today
* How long it takes to log someone in
* If any login attempts failed and why


It's basically giving you eyes and ears inside your application so you can keep it healthy and running smoothly!





## Telemetry is the one package in Python, right?


The main package is opentelemetry, but it's made up of several sub-packages for different things:

| Role | What You Use | What It Does |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| API | opentelemetry.trace | You use it in your code to create spans and traces |
| SDK | opentelemetry.sdk.trace | Processes and sends the trace data to a destination (like a dashboard or log file) |
| Exporter | opentelemetry-exporter-* | Defines where the telemetry data goes (e.g., console, Jaeger, OTLP) |

| Role | What You Use | What It Does |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Auto-Instrumentation | opentelemetry-instrumentation-* | Automatically adds tracing, metrics, or logging to popular libraries (like Flask, Django, requests, SQLAlchemy) without changing your app's code manually |



| Package | What It Instruments |
|---------|-------------------|
| opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask | Automatically traces Flask routes and handlers |
| opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests | Automatically traces outgoing HTTP requests |
| opentelemetry-instrumentation-sqlalchemy | Automatically traces database queries |

So instead of manually wrapping every function or endpoint, auto-instrumentation hooks into the library and generates telemetry data for you.




## Q. If I want to create a trace, then I am calling OpenTelemetry.trace. And that will start to create the trace for the code.

‚úÖ Correct!
You're calling the API part: opentelemetry.trace.get_tracer() to create spans (traces of what your code is doing).
But without the SDK, those spans go nowhere ‚Äî they're collected, but not processed or exported.

And after that, in the SDK part, I'm calling OpenTelemetry.sdk. And we are processing the traces into, like, importing to somewhere else. ‚úÖ Exactly! You use opentelemetry.sdk.trace to:
* Set up a TracerProvider
* Add processors and exporters This is how you send the data to a backend (like the console, OTLP endpoint, Jaeger, etc.).



## What Does the SDK Process?

### 1. Sampling

Decides whether to record a trace or not, based on rules you define.
	
							OR	

Should we record this data or skip it?

							OR	

Should we record every user request or just a sample?

* Example: Only record 1 out of every 100 requests to reduce overhead.


```python
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.sampling import TraceIdRatioBased
provider = TracerProvider(sampler=TraceIdRatioBased(0.1))  # Sample 10%
```


======================================================================================================

### 2. Context Propagation

Keeps track of the trace context across function calls  or services.
* Example: A request starts in one service and continues into another ‚Äî context needs to follow it.


‚úâÔ∏è Example: Mailing a Package with a Tracking Number
Imagine you're sending a package through a delivery service.
* At the first post office, the package gets a tracking number.
* As it moves through sorting centers, trucks, and delivery hubs, that tracking number follows it everywhere.
* No matter where it goes, the system knows: "This is the same package."

üß† In OpenTelemetry terms:
* The tracking number is the trace context.
* As the request moves between different parts of your app (functions, threads, microservices), the context propagation ensures every part of the journey is linked to the same "package" (trace).
* That's how you get a full picture of the request's lifecycle.



Without context propagation, it would be like trying to track a package with no label ‚Äî every step would look disconnected!

======================================================================================================


### 3. Span Processing

Handles what happens when a span ends:
* Buffers it
* Modifies it if needed
* Sends it to the configured exporter


			OR

Process spans (add metadata, adjust formatting) before exporting


You attach a span processor for this:

```python
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor, ConsoleSpanExporter
span_processor = SimpleSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter())
provider.add_span_processor(span_processor)
```


‚úÖ What is a Span?
A span represents a single unit of work in your system ‚Äî like a function call, a database query, or an HTTP request.
Each span contains:
* A name (e.g., "GET /login")
* Start and end timestamps
* Attributes (metadata like user ID, status code, etc.)
* Events and error logs (optional)
* Links to parent/child spans (for full trace view)

üîÑ What is Span Processing?
Span Processing is what happens after a span is finished (i.e., after the code inside with tracer.start_as_current_span() completes). The SDK uses span processors to decide what to do with that span.



üß† Why Span Processing is Important:
You don't want every span just sitting in memory. You want to:
* Buffer it
* Filter or modify it if needed
* Export it to a backend system (like Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog, etc.)
Span processors handle all of that automatically.



üîß Types of Span Processors
#### 1. SimpleSpanProcessor
* Sends the span immediately after it ends.
* Good for development or debugging.


```python
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor, ConsoleSpanExporter
span_processor = SimpleSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter())
provider.add_span_processor(span_processor)
```

#### 2. BatchSpanProcessor

It's like a mailbox that collects spans (telemetry data) and sends them in groups, instead of one at a time.

* Buffers spans and sends them in batches for better performance.
* Recommended for production use.



```python
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor, OTLPSpanExporter
otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter()
batch_processor = BatchSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter)
provider.add_span_processor(batch_processor)
```

üì¶ Real-life analogy:
Imagine you're sending packages:
* SimpleSpanProcessor ‚Üí You go to the post office every time you have one package.
* BatchSpanProcessor ‚Üí You wait until you have a few packages, then go send them all at once.


Span processing is the bridge between "I recorded something" and "It's now visible in my observability tool." It controls how, when, and where your spans are sent after they're created.

======================================================================================================



### 4. Exporting Telemetry
Sends the final telemetry data (spans, metrics, logs) to an exporter, like:
* Console (for debugging)
* OTLP endpoint
* Jaeger
* Prometheus
* Datadog, etc.

Send the telemetry to tools like Jaeger, Grafana, or Datadog



======================================================================================================


## üîß Automatic Instrumentation for Popular Frameworks


You install opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask, and it automatically tracks your Flask app's requests, errors, and timing ‚Äî without changing your Flask code manually.


## üåê Vendor-Neutral Data Collection

You collect telemetry data once, and it can be sent to any monitoring tool ‚Äî Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, etc.
You're not locked in to any single vendor.



## üß† The Three Pillars of Observability



### 1. üìä TRACES - 
It Shows the complete journey of a single request through your distributed system.



Technical Details:

* Span: Individual operation (like a function call)
* Trace: Collection of spans showing the full request flow
* Context Propagation: Passes trace information between services



```
HTTP Request ‚Üí Auth Service ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Payment API ‚Üí Response
    |              |            |           |
  Span 1        Span 2      Span 3     Span 4
```


Real Example:

```
Trace ID: abc123
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Span: API Gateway (200ms)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Span: User Service (50ms)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Span: Database Query (30ms)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Span: Payment Service (120ms)
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Span: External API Call (100ms)
```


### 2. üìà METRICS -
It Numerical measurements over time.


| Metric Type | Car Example | App Example |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Counter | Odometer ‚Äì it only increases | http_requests_total ‚Äì number of requests handled |
| Gauge | Speedometer or fuel level ‚Äì goes up/down | memory_usage_bytes ‚Äì current memory used |
| Histogram | Trip computer showing time ranges per trip | response_time_histogram ‚Äì how many requests fall into each response time bucket |

üü¢ Example: http_requests_total
This Counter tracks how many total HTTP requests have occurred since the app started.
* You had 1,000 requests yesterday.
* Today you had 500 more.
* The counter becomes 1,500.
Even if no requests are happening now, the total still stays at 1,500 ‚Äî it never goes down.



Examples:

```
http_requests_total{method="GET", status="200"} = 1,234
memory_usage_bytes = 512,000,000
response_time_histogram{le="0.1"} = 45
```




### 3. üìù LOGS -
It Structured event records with context.

Technical Structure:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-05-29T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "message": "Database connection failed",
  "trace_id": "abc123",
  "span_id": "def456",
  "attributes": {
    "service": "user-service",
    "database": "postgres",
    "error_code": "CONNECTION_TIMEOUT"
  }
}
```


## üèóÔ∏è OpenTelemetry Architecture

Ôøº


## üõ†Ô∏è Integration Deep Dive

### Step 1: Choose Your Instrumentation Strategy


### ü§ñ Automatic Instrumentation (Easy Mode)

The SDK automatically instruments popular libraries:



```python
# Python example
from opentelemetry.auto_instrumentation import autoinstrument

autoinstrument()  # Magic! Instruments Flask, Django, requests, etc.
```


What gets instrumented automatically:
* HTTP clients/servers
* Database calls (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
* Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
* Caching systems (Redis, Memcached)


						OR


üì∑ Think of it like installing smart sensors in your home.

ü§ñ Automatic Instrumentation
You buy smart devices that already come with sensors built-in.
* Smart lights track when they're on/off
* Smart thermostats track temperature
* Smart doorbells track who rings
‚úÖ No manual setup ‚Äî you just plug them in.




### üéØ Manual Instrumentation (Control Mode)
Add custom spans for business logic:

```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def process_order(order_id):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("process_order") as span:
        span.set_attribute("order.id", order_id)
        span.set_attribute("order.amount", order.total)
        
        # Your business logic here
        result = validate_payment(order)
        
        if result.success:
            span.set_status(trace.Status(trace.StatusCode.OK))
        else:
            span.set_status(trace.Status(trace.StatusCode.ERROR))
            span.record_exception(result.error)
```



						OR

You manually install custom motion sensors in areas you care most about ‚Äî like a safe or garage. You define:
* Where they go
* What to monitor
* What counts as a "critical event"
‚úÖ More control, but takes effort.



### Step 2: Configuration Magic

The YAML config defines how telemetry flows inside the collector


otel-config.yaml:
* Receivers: how data comes in (OTLP gRPC/HTTP)
* Processors: what to do with data (batch it, add tags)
* Exporters: where to send it (Jaeger, Prometheus)



```yaml
exporters:
  jaeger:
    endpoint: http://jaeger:14250
  prometheus:
    endpoint: "0.0.0.0:8889"
```


üß† This is your smart home control panel.
You set up rules like:
* If motion is detected, send alert
* If temperature > 30¬∞C, turn on AC
* Batch alerts every 1 minute to avoid spam


‚úÖ This is what the YAML config does in OpenTelemetry ‚Äî it controls:
* How data flows
* What's filtered or batched
* Where it's sent (like Jaeger = your home dashboard)





üì¶ Final Analogy: The Whole Flow
Imagine OpenTelemetry as a smart factory monitoring system:
1. Instrumentation = installing smart sensors (auto or manual)
2. Collector Config = setting up the factory control system (routes, filters, outputs)





## üö® Common Integration Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Performance Impact
Problem: "OpenTelemetry is slowing down my app!"
Solutions:

```python
# Use sampling to reduce overhead
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.sampling import TraceIdRatioBasedSampler

# Only trace 10% of requests
sampler = TraceIdRatioBasedSampler(rate=0.1)

# Use batching for exports
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
processor = BatchSpanProcessor(exporter, max_export_batch_size=512)
```






## ‚òï Java + OpenTelemetry: Complete Integration Guide


### üéØ What You'll Learn
By the end of this guide, your Java application will have:
* ‚úÖ Automatic tracing for HTTP requests, database calls, and more
* ‚úÖ Custom business logic tracing
* ‚úÖ Metrics collection
* ‚úÖ Structured logging with trace correlation
* ‚úÖ Production-ready configuration



### üöÄ Method 1: Auto-Instrumentation (Fastest Way)
#### Step 1: Download the Java Agent


```bash
# Download the latest OpenTelemetry Java agent
curl -L -o opentelemetry-javaagent.jar \
  https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
```



#### Step 2: Run Your Application

```bash
java -javaagent:opentelemetry-javaagent.jar \
     -Dotel.service.name=my-java-app \
     -Dotel.service.version=1.0.0 \
     -Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://localhost:4318 \
     -jar your-application.jar
```

These -Dotel.* flags configure:
* The service name (how it's identified in traces)
* The OTLP endpoint (where traces/metrics/logs go)
* Optional: service version, environment, etc.


üéâ That's it! Your app is now automatically instrumented!
What Gets Auto-Instrumented?
‚úÖ Web Frameworks: Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Servlets, JAX-RS ‚úÖ HTTP Clients: Apache HttpClient, OkHttp, Retrofit ‚úÖ Databases: JDBC, Hibernate, MyBatis, MongoDB ‚úÖ Message Queues: Kafka, RabbitMQ, JMS ‚úÖ Caching: Redis, Ehcache ‚úÖ And 100+ more libraries!


## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

## Grafana Loki:-


Grafana Loki and Coralogix are both application log management solutions, but they serve similar purposes with different approaches. Let me break down the comparison:

### üéØ Yes, They're Similar - Both Handle Application Logs
Core Purpose (Both Do This):

* Application log aggregation and analysis
* Real-time log monitoring and searching
* Dashboard creation and visualization
* Alerting based on log patterns
* Integration with observability ecosystems

Summery of this blog


### üì° What is a Protocol?
A protocol is just a set of rules that defines how data is sent and received between systems.
Think of it like:
A language both sides agree to speak so they can understand each other.



### üì¶ What is the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)?
OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) is the official protocol used by OpenTelemetry to send telemetry data like:
* üìç Traces
* üìà Metrics
* üìì Logs
‚Ä¶from your application ‚Üí to a backend (like Jaeger, Prometheus, or a collector).


### üîÑ What does OTLP do?

It defines how telemetry data is structured and transmitted ‚Äî typically using:
* gRPC (fast, binary, efficient)
* or HTTP/JSON (easier to debug, widely supported)




### üß™ What is gRPC?
gRPC stands for Google Remote Procedure Call. It's a high-performance, open-source protocol for sending data between services.


You can think of gRPC as:
üõéÔ∏è A super-efficient waiter who carries structured messages between tables (apps) quickly and clearly.

when OpenTelemetry sends traces/metrics/logs using OTLP over gRPC, it's doing it:
* Faster than HTTP/JSON
* In a more consistent and reliable way



### üß∞ OpenTelemetry Collector: What is it?

The OpenTelemetry Collector is like a smart data pipeline. It collects data (like logs, metrics, and traces) from your applications, processes it, and sends it to the right tool for viewing (like Jaeger, SigNoz, or Prometheus).


#### 1. üì• Receivers

Think of receivers as "input ports". They listen for incoming data from apps or other systems.

* Example: Your app sends trace data using OTLP or Jaeger format ‚Äî the receiver grabs it.
* Common formats: OTLP, Jaeger, Zipkin
üß† Receivers = How the Collector gets the data.

#### 2. üß™ Processors
Once the data is received, processors act like filters or tools to clean, organize, or reduce the data.
* They can:
    * Filter out unwanted data
    * Sample only a small percent of traces (to reduce volume)
    * Add custom tags or metadata
* You can connect many processors in a row for complex logic.
üß† Processors = What the Collector does with the data before sending it out.


#### 3. üì§ Exporters
Exporters are like "output ports". They send the processed data to your chosen observability tool ‚Äî like Jaeger, SigNoz, Prometheus, or a file.
* Common protocols: OTLP, Prometheus, Jaeger
üß† Exporters = Where the Collector sends the data.



#### 4. üîÑ Connectors
Connectors are special pieces that link different pipelines inside one Collector.
* A connector can:
    * Act like a bridge ‚Äî taking data from one pipeline and sending it into another.
    * Help reuse or transform data between different parts of the system.


‚úÖ Real Use Case Example
Let's say:
You have a Collector that:
* Receives traces from your app.
* Sends those traces to Jaeger.
* Also converts those traces into metrics and sends them to Prometheus.
Solution:
You create two pipelines:
1. Trace pipeline ‚Üí receives data and exports to Jaeger
2. Metrics pipeline ‚Üí uses a connector to convert traces into metrics, then exports to Prometheus
Connector = bridge between the trace pipeline and the metrics pipeline.



### üöö What Is Distributed Tracing?

Distributed tracing is the way to track a request through many services, while a Trace is one recorded journey of a single request.

| Term | What It Is | Think of It As |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Distributed Tracing | A technique or system used to track requests | The whole CCTV system |
| Trace | A single recorded journey of one request | One CCTV video of a package delivery |


üßë‚Äçüíª Imagine This:
You order a pizza online. The request (your order) goes through:
1. üßë‚Äçüç≥ The kitchen (web server)
2. üßæ The billing counter (database)
3. üßä The fridge (cache)
4. üõµ The delivery guy (external API)

‚úÖ Now,
* Distributed Tracing is the tracking system that watches your pizza from order to delivery.
* A Trace is the record of your pizza order's journey, showing where it went, how long each step took.

Distributed tracing is the act of watching, and a trace is the story of one request.



‚úîÔ∏è "Distributed Tracing" is a concept or technique
It's a general term ‚Äî not actual data. It describes how we track and observe requests across services.


‚úîÔ∏è "Trace" is the actual data
A trace is the real record of one request going through the system ‚Äî made up of spans.


So yes ‚Äî Distributed Tracing is not a logical unit or object like a trace. It's the process or idea behind capturing those traces

### üì¶ What Is a Trace?
A trace shows the complete path a request follows, from start to finish. It's made up of smaller parts called spans.

### üî∏ What Is a Span?
A span is like a single task or operation in the whole journey.
For example:
* A span can represent the web server handling the request
* Another span can represent the database call
* Another one for calling an external API
Each span tracks:
* Start & end time
* Duration
* What it was doing (e.g., GET /api/products)
* Extra info like status, events, and tags

### üå≥ Parent Span vs. Child Spans
When a request starts:
* The first span is the parent span (also called the root span)
* Any other tasks it performs (like DB or API calls) are child spans
Example:
Parent span: Handling HTTP request Child spans:
* Querying database
* Calling an external API
* Reading from cache
This helps you see which part is slow or has errors.




```json
{
  "name": "sample_licious_span",
  "trace_id": "01234...",
  "span_id": "abcd...",
  "parent_span_id": "abcd...",  ‚Üê links it to its parent
  "start_time": ..., 
  "end_time": ..., 
  "status": { "code": "OK" },
  "attributes": [
    { "key": "http.method", "value": "GET" },
    { "key": "http.url", "value": "https://licious.com/api" }
  ],
  "events": [
    { "name": "event_name", ... }
  ]
}
```



This JSON shows:
* What was done (GET https://licious.com/api)
* When it started and ended
* Whether it succeeded (status: OK)
* And extra events that happened during this span


### üõ†Ô∏è How Does This Work in Code?
You don't have to build all of this by hand.
OpenTelemetry provides:
* SDKs and auto-instrumentation
* APIs to create spans
* It automatically tracks the parent-child relationship
So when your app handles a request, it automatically creates a parent span. If that request calls a database, it automatically creates a child span and links it to the parent.

### üéØ What is Context Propagation?


In context propagation, it's like delivering a package with a single tracking ID. As the package moves through many small delivery vehicles and stops (like local trucks or hubs), that same tracking ID stays with it. This allows us to track the entire journey from start to end, even though different people or systems handled it along the way.


### üì¶ What's Inside This "Tracking Info"?
The context info usually includes:
* üÜî Trace ID: Like a tracking number ‚Äî same for the entire journey.
* üî¢ Span ID: Identifies each individual step.
* üéØ Sampling info: Whether to actually record this request or not.



### üßë‚Äçüíª Example: Two Services (A ‚Üí B)
1. Service A gets the first request. It creates a trace ID and a span ID, and puts them in a special HTTP header (like an envelope).
2. It sends the request to Service B, along with that header.
3. Service B reads the header, gets the trace/span info, and continues the trace, linking its actions back to Service A.
4. If Service B talks to Service C, it does the same thing ‚Äî passing along the trace info.
This way, all services know they're working on the same request, and their spans can be connected to form one complete trace.



### üè∑Ô∏è Two Common Header Formats
There are two popular formats for passing this context info:

#### 1. W3C Trace Context (industry standard)
* traceparent: Main header with trace ID and span ID.
* tracestate: Optional, extra data.

üìå Used by: OpenTelemetry, Azure Monitor, AWS X-Ray (via adapters), etc

#### 2. B3 (from Zipkin)
* X-B3-TraceId: The trace ID
* X-B3-SpanId: The current step's ID
* X-B3-Sampled: Should we trace this or skip?

üìå Used by: Zipkin, Istio, older systems.

Both formats do the same job ‚Äî just slightly different ways of packing the info.

These formats are just different ways to pass tracking info between services, so tracing tools can follow the full request journey.


### ü§ñ OpenTelemetry Makes It Easy
If you use OpenTelemetry, you don't need to worry about manually adding or reading these headers.
It automatically:

* Creates the trace/span IDs
* Sends the correct headers
* Connects spans across services
So everything gets traced properly with almost no extra work.


| Term | Simple Meaning |
|------|----------------|
| Context Propagation | Passing trace info (like IDs) between services |
| Why it matters | So we can link all parts of one request into a full trace |
| W3C / B3 | Two formats for passing this info in headers |

### üß† What Is OpenTelemetry Operator?


Imagine you want to install a smart system in your app to track performance and errors automatically ‚Äî like adding GPS to your delivery trucks to track every move.

But setting that up manually in Kubernetes is hard‚Ä¶ That's where the OpenTelemetry Operator comes in.


### üîÅ What Happens (Step-by-Step):
1. üë§ User creates a custom configuration (like a checklist saying: "I want to collect telemetry data from my app").
2. ‚öôÔ∏è OpenTelemetry Operator reads that config, and:
    * Installs the OpenTelemetry Collector (a service that receives the telemetry data).
    * Injects an Auto-Instrumentation Sidecar into your app pod (a little helper that automatically tracks your app's behavior without changing the code).
3. üì¶ Your application pod runs as usual, and the sidecar tracks everything (like HTTP calls, DB queries, etc.).
4. üîÑ The sidecar sends this telemetry data to the OpenTelemetry Collector.
5. üíæ The Collector forwards the data to storage (like Jaeger, SigNoz, or any backend you use for monitoring).

### üìå What's Happening at Licious?
Licious is using OpenTelemetry to watch and track user requests as they travel through its system ‚Äî like how food delivery apps let you track your order from kitchen to doorstep.



### üõ†Ô∏è How It's Done (Without Manual Work):
* They use something called the OpenTelemetry Operator.
* This automatically adds tracing to apps ‚Äî no need to change the code.
* Makes setup fast and easy, especially in Kubernetes.



### üß† What Licious Built:
They built an internal monitoring dashboard using:
* Jaeger
* SigNoz (both are free tools that show traces visually).
